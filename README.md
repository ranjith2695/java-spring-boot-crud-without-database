Prerequisites:

   -  Java application code hosted on a Git repository
   -  Jenkins server
   -  Kubernetes cluster
   -  Argo CD

     
Steps:

    1. Install the necessary Jenkins plugins:
       1.1 Git plugin
       1.2 Maven Integration plugin
       1.3 Pipeline plugin
       1.4 Kubernetes Continuous Deploy plugin

    2. Create a new Jenkins pipeline:
       2.1 In Jenkins, create a new pipeline job and configure it with the Git repository URL for the Java application.
       2.2 Add a Jenkinsfile to the Git repository to define the pipeline stages.

    3. Define the pipeline stages:
        Stage 1: Checkout the source code from Git.
        Stage 2: Build the Java application using Maven.
        Stage 3: Package the application into a JAR file.
        Stage 4: Run user acceptance tests on the deployed application.
        Stage 5: Promote the application to a production environment using Argo CD.

    4. Configure Jenkins pipeline stages:
        Stage 1: Use the Git plugin to check out the source code from the Git repository.
        Stage 2: Use the Maven Integration plugin to build the Java application.
        Stage 3: Use the Maven Integration plugin to package the application into a JAR file.
        Stage 4: Use the Kubernetes Continuous Deploy plugin to deploy the application to a test environment using Helm.
        Stage 5: Use Argo CD to promote the application to a production environment.      

    5. Set up Argo CD:
        Install Argo CD on the Kubernetes cluster.
        Set up a Git repository for Argo CD to track the changes Kubernetes manifests.
